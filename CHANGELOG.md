## 1.3.0
### Added
- **Simple Date Picker (Minimal Mode)**:
  - A lightweight, scroll-based picker using three Cupertino-style wheels (Year / Month / Day).
  - Supports both **Jalali** and **Gregorian** calendars.
  - Respects `initialDate` and `lastDate` limits â€” users can only scroll within the valid date range.
  - Customizable appearance:
    - `selectedItemStyle`, `itemStyle`, and `selectedItemBackgroundColor`
    - Adjustable `itemHeight`
    - Custom select and clear buttons (`selectDateButtonText`, `clearDateButton`)
